 2013...one of the most memorable year of my life. 
 14th february,2013..A day when I became brother-in-law and a day which took my sister to the next door of my home.
 Disha,Though I wont be able to fight any more,though you wont be able to save me from dad's anger,though I wont be able eat my favourite dishes of your hand,
 I looked forward to it and see you got best lifepartner. 
 29th may,last day of my engineering.. A day which gave me a new name-Er.Tarkik Shah and A day when my papa said:I am proud of you,my son.
 Though I wont be able to "bunk" lectures,though I wont be able to meet my fnds daily,though I wont be able to party like a king in college, I looked forward to it and see I got a job.1st job of my life..Biggest day of my life. New beginning,new friends,professional atmosphere. 
 I was little scared but I looked forward to it and see I am totally in love with this place and working environment.
